## Compiling

- Download FMOD Programmers API (you'll need a license, but it's free) and put in the `deps` folder
- Make sure you have CMake >= 3.8
- Create a `build` folder in the repo root directory
- From inside the `build` folder, run `cmake .. && make` to populate the root `bin` folder.

Now you can run it at `../bin/imp`
